This project implements an AI-powered trading bot using the Lumibot framework and the Alpaca API. The core idea is to automate the process of buying and selling assets (e.g., BTC-USD) using machine learning models trained on historical data and real-time market signals.

ðŸ”§ Components
Lumibot: A Python-based algorithmic trading library that simplifies strategy development, backtesting, and live deployment.

Alpaca API: A commission-free brokerage API used for market data access and order execution (supports paper and live trading).

Machine Learning: AI models (e.g., regression, classification) are used to predict future price movements or generate buy/sell signals.

ðŸ“Š Strategy Framework
Data Collection: Historical and real-time price data are gathered from Alpaca and/or other sources.

Feature Engineering: Relevant indicators (technical, statistical, sentiment-based) are extracted from the raw data.

Model Prediction: A trained machine learning model predicts asset price movements or trading signals.

Signal Generation: Based on predictions and thresholds, the bot decides whether to buy, sell, or hold.

Backtesting & Execution: Strategies are tested on historical data and executed in real-time using Alpaca.

ðŸŽ¯ Objectives
Achieve consistent, data-driven returns.

Avoid emotional or biased trading decisions.

Enable 24/7 autonomous trading with real-time adaptability.
